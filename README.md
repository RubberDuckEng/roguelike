# Bug reports
(1) "you have to add the die thing"
(3) the "hole" to the next level can get lost under the HUD

- Do the bad guys hurt you or not?
- It's not hitting me (not clear what movement is per turn).
- "The different levels are not very hard"
- "We should put more walls or make the map harder to see or make it harder to get to the map or add more bad guys"
- Unclear what the items do
- No indication that you take damage.
