## Bug reports

(1) "you have to add the die thing"
(3) the "hole" to the next level can get lost under the HUD

- Do the bad guys hurt you or not?
- It's not hitting me (not clear what movement is per turn).
- "The different levels are not very hard"
- "We should put more walls or make the map harder to see or make it harder to get to the map or add more bad guys"
- Unclear what the items do
- No indication that you take damage.


# New Game idea:

## Theme ideas

* Open World
* Build Your Way Out
* Descent into Madness
* Parallel Universe
* Inconvenient Superpowers
* Death Is A New Beginning
* Color Changes Everything

## Thoughts
* 2D
* Worlds could be at differnet scale
* Decending into layers could provide you access into things to change them?
* Game should be fun, even if you never get to the end?
* Want to be able to link to the built world.
* 

k meets factorio meets zelda?

## MVP notes
* Travel between rooms (zelda style)
* Zoom in and out.
* Pick up blocks
* Still turn based?
* Turning pc is done based on movement (like in zelda)
* When less than 50% of the way through a block, revert back to previous block.
* Move to using a triangle for PC
* Move to using Key up/key down instead of key-press.
* Draw highlight on the square you'll snap

Things to do
* Change enemies to spawn based on proximity.
* Change enemies to be active while in lit.
* Time of day?

## Animation notes
* Screen transitions
* Attack animations
* Take damage
* Bumping into wall animations
* Sprite walking?
* Moving between
* Flicker animations?


Emotionally
* Earth right after crust has cooled
* End of the game, cities, oceans, reached the modern world.
* As you progres through the game, you become "lifeform level X" which operates at greater scale.
* Whatever you did at Lifeform level x-1, the NPCs should do for you.
* Game where you are a hand and you could punish or reward the cat for what it did.  You could reward or punish.
* At the end, should be teming with life.
* At the beginning you are an ameoma.  Later you're a cat.  But still amoba level things shoudl still happen.

## Terrain ideas
* Only passible with certain items (e.g. deep water)
* Takes more turns to pass (e.g. shallow water)
* Does damage through passing (e.g. fire)
* Disables or removes certain items when passing.
* Traps
* Single movement direction allowed (conveyer belts?)
* Accelerates movement

## Passive Item Ideas
* Gold
* Things which change avatar (clothing, wigs, dye, etc.)
* Passive Damage reduction (armor)
* Temporary damage reduction (sheild)
* Weapon types (just drop current when picking up new)
* AOE Weapons
* Ranged Weapons
* Use-limited weapons
* Throwable weapons (have to go pick them up after)
* Weapons with different attack areas
* Health capacity increase (Heart Containers)
* Something heals you on hit
* Something which does extra damage
* Passive Healing regen
* Changes light radius
* Stealth
* Invulnerability
* Walk through walls
* Damages nearby enemies passively
* Tools (for affecting blocks)
* Movement items (make you go faster, be able to pass traps w/o triggering, etc.)


## Active Item ideas
* Bomb (will need a fuse)
* Active healing
* Wands
* Clear all enemies
*
