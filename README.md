## Bug reports

(1) "you have to add the die thing"
(3) the "hole" to the next level can get lost under the HUD

- Do the bad guys hurt you or not?
- It's not hitting me (not clear what movement is per turn).
- "The different levels are not very hard"
- "We should put more walls or make the map harder to see or make it harder to get to the map or add more bad guys"
- Unclear what the items do
- No indication that you take damage.


# New Game idea:

## Theme ideas

* Open World

* Inconvenient Superpowers
* Death Is A New Beginning
* Color Changes Everything

## Thoughts
* 2D
* Worlds could be at differnet scale
* Decending into layers could provide you access into things to change them?
* Game should be fun, even if you never get to the end?
* Want to be able to link to the built world.
* 

2d minecraft meets factorio meets zelda?

## MVP notes
* Travel between rooms (zelda style)
* Zoom in and out.
* Pick up blocks
* Still turn based?
* Turning pc is done based on movement (like in zelda)
* When less than 50% of the way through a block, revert back to previous block.
* Move to using a triangle for PC
* Move to using Key up/key down instead of key-press.
* Draw highlight on the square you'll snap

Things to do
* Change enemies to spawn based on proximity.
* Change enemies to be active while in lit.
* Time of day?

## Animation notes
